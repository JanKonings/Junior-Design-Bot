# Junior Design Project: Autonomous Bot RC Bot Using Arduino | EE31 | Fall 2025
### Made by: Jan Konings, Drew Galen, Isaac Medina, and Ryan Chen
### Tufts University
### School of Engineering | Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
This project uses an Arduino UNO R2 Wifi to implement an autonomous bot that follows a specific "arena" style course given by the course instructions. The bot was designed for robustness and is 
able to perform the course as either "bot 1" or "bot 2".
