# Junior Design Project: Autonomous Bot RC Bot Using Arduino UNO WiFi Rev2| EE31 | Fall 2025
### Made by: Jan Konings, Drew Galen, Isaac Medina, and Ryan Chen
### Tufts University
### School of Engineering | Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
This project uses an Arduino UNO Wifi Rev2 to implement an autonomous bot that follows a specific "arena" style course given by the course instructions. The goal of the project was to design a robust bot that can perform the course as either "bot 1" or "bot 2".
